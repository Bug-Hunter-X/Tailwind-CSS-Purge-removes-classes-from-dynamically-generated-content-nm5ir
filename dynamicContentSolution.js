Several solutions exist to handle dynamically added Tailwind classes:

**1. Whitelisting Classes:** Add the potentially missing classes to the `purge` configuration's `whitelist` or `whitelistPatterns` options. This prevents PurgeCSS from removing them, regardless of their presence in the initial HTML.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: {
    content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.js'],
    whitelist: ['my-dynamic-class'], // Add your dynamic class here
    // ...
  },
  // ...
};
```

**2.  Using `@apply` directive:** Instead of dynamically adding classes, use the `@apply` directive within your existing classes.  This ensures the styles are present in the compiled CSS without relying on dynamic class addition.

**3.  Safelisting:** If you want to add all the missing classes, you can use `safelist` option instead of `whitelist`
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: {
    content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.js'],
    safelist: [/^my-dynamic-class-/], // Add your dynamic class pattern here
    // ...
  },
  // ...
};
```

**4. Adjusting the Build Process:**  If you generate your content as a post-build step, adjust the build process so that PurgeCSS runs *after* the dynamic content generation. This ensures all classes are included before the final CSS is created.  This would require changes to your build system (e.g., Webpack, Parcel).

Choose the solution that best fits your project's structure and build process.
